Jetpack Dinosaur Challenge 5 - Code Party #1

I'm writing a book to teach others how to code in objective-c. This is the fifth app the reader will make in the book. This app is called a "Code Party". It is a review (and celebration) of everything the reader has learned so far.

App Description:

Build a coin that flips heads or tails

Concepts Learned:

Reviewing evertyhing learned in section 1 of Jetpack Dinosuar. This includes everything from objects vs. methods to custom classes.
